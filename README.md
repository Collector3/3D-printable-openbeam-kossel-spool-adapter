# Openbeam Kossel Pro Spool Adapter

If you have a few of these Replicator 2 spool holders lying around: [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44906](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44906) and want to use them..

... you can print this mount and attach it onto one of the Kossel Pro's upright extrusions.

There is a little lip printed on the open side to keep the holder from easily sliding out, 
so to release, pull the holder up, and out.

Updated 2015-01-21: The spool holder now takes a bit of effort to insert/remove the first few times, but is 
now more secure overall. I'm still spooling filament with the older version, and haven't had trouble, so 
you don't need to upgrade unless you really want to.

## Instructions

Print: 30% infill, 3 perimeters.
Mounting hardware: 3 M3 x 6mm BHCS (these are in the Kossel Pro kit).
